# Changelog

[Shamil Kashmeri](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105291845791114608759) asked whether he should upgrade from 0.1 to 0.3 and I thought it would be a good idea for making a changelog instead of explaining the new features everytime someone asks.

Each version section also has instructions on how to modify your existing logSys calls to work on the new version.

## 0.9

* 2 Step Login
    * 2 Step Login process is done now with exceptions
    * Added `Fr\LS\TwoStepLogin` exception class
    * Added try limit for entering token. For this `config` -> `two_step_login` -> `token_tries` has been added. Default : 3
    * Revoking the device which is used by user will force a logout
* Requesting tokens more than **5** times will cause account to be blocked
  This can be changed with `config` -> `brute_force` -> `max_tokens`
* All result from database is regarded [as strings or null](https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#returntypes)
* Fixed `Fr\LS::joinedSince()` bug
* Added `Fr\LS::getDeviceID()`
* Added `Fr\LS::userIDExists()`
* Added `Fr\LS::removeToken()`
* Follow PSR standards
    * Changed `Fr\LS::rand_string()` to `Fr\LS::randStr()`

## 0.8

* logSys is now an object class. Static methods has been replaced
* logSys object is passed by reference as first parameter to all callbacks

### Object

Instead of this :

```
\Fr\LS::config($config);
```

This is the new way :

```
$LS = new \Fr\LS($config);
```

All the functions can be called just like before but on `$LS` object :

```
$LS->login();
$LS->register();
$LS->forgotPassword();
```

### Callbacks

The first parameter of all callbacks will be the logSys object passed by reference. So, if you had a callback like this before :

```
"send_callback" => function($userID, $token){
    ...
}
```

You should replace that with this :

```
"send_callback" => function(&$LS, $userID, $token){
    ...
}
```
